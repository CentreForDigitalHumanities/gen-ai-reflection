    <p i18n>
        Welcome to the <strong>GenAI reflection tool</strong>. The aim of this
        tool is to stimulate <strong>reflection</strong> on the impact of
        generative AI on academic teaching. Students can use generative AI for
        almost all assignments. The question whether assessment forms need to be
        adapted as a consequence of this, depends on the
        <strong>intended learning outcomes</strong> that the assignments test.
        This is why this tool aims to make an explicit link between assessment
        forms and learning outcomes. Wherever the use of generative AI is
        considered problematic, the tool provides
        <strong>alternative assessment forms</strong>, or stimulates you to
        consider changing the learning outcomes.
