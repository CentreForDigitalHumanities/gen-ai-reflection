    <h1 i18n>Step 3: Course Integration</h1>

    <p i18n>
        Here, you are invited to reconsider exercises or assignments by
        involving generative AI to various extents. The AI assessment scale that
        this step is based on, has officially been accepted by the UU as a
        guiding principle. It helps teachers to think of generative AI in a less
        binary manner – not as something that is either forbidden or approved,
        but as a set of tools that can be integrated in academic education to
        different degrees.

    <p i18n>
        Click on one of the five scales to find examples of educational
        exercises or assignments that make use of generative AI to different
        degrees (scales 2-5) or not at all (scale 1). You can check off examples
        that you are interested in. These will be included in your final report.
