    This report summarizes your reflection about the role of GenAI in the above mentioned course. The aim of this
    report is to stimulate reflection on the impact of generative AI on academic teaching. Students can use
    generative AI for almost all assignments. The question whether assessment forms need to be adapted as a
    consequence of this, depends on the intended learning outcomes that the assignments test. This is why this
    report aims to make an explicit link between assessment forms and learning outcomes. Wherever the use of
    generative AI is considered problematic, the tool provides alternative assessment forms, or stimulates you to
    consider changing the learning outcomes.

<h2>Step 1: Learning Outcomes</h2>

{% for outcome in learning_outcomes %}
<h3>{{ outcome.text }}</h3>
<p>Dublin indicator: {{ outcome.dublin_indicator }}</p>
<h4>AI Challenges</h4>
<ul>
    {% for challenge in outcome.challenges %}
    <li>{{ challenge }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
<h4>AI Opportunities</h4>
<ul>
    {% for opportunity in outcome.opportunities %}
    <li>{{ opportunity }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endfor %}

<h2>Step 2: Assessment Forms</h2>

{% for assessment in assessments %}
<h3>{{ assessment.assessment_form }}</h3>

<h4>Known AI Uses</h4>

<ul>
    {% for use in assessment.known_ai_uses %}
    <li>{{ use.text }}
        <ul>
            {% for example in use.examples.all %}
            <li>{{ example.text }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

<h4>Connected learning outcomes</h4>

<ul>
{% for ilo in assessment.learning_outcomes %}
<li>{{ ilo }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h4>Impact of AI on assessment</h4>

{% if assessment.affected %}
<p>The use of AI <strong>does</strong> affect the extent to which this learning goal can be tested by this assignment. Suggested adjustments:</p>

<ul>
    {% for adjustment in assessment.adjustments %}
    <li>{{ adjustment }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% else %}
<p>The use of AI <strong>does not</strong> affect the extent to which this learning goal can be tested by this assignment.</p>
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

<h2>Step 3: Course Integration</h2>

{% for scale in course_integration %}

{% if scale.examples %}
<h3>{{ scale.scale }}</h3>

<ul>
    {% for example in scale.examples %}
    <li>{{ example }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
